# Operate First SRE Content

## Introduction
This the Operate First repository for Site Reliability documentation. Here we
intend to collect documentation on the nitty-gritty aspects of building and
operating an effective Site Reliability organisation. 

## Who runs this repository?
Hello! We're the Red Hat SIG-SRE group, a cross-team group of people inside Red
Hat with an interest in promoting and developing strong SRE culture. As a
result you can expect some of the material here to be a little slanted toward
the way we do things here inside Red Hat, but as we're doing our best to stick
to what are generally accepted to be good SRE practices you should be able to
make use of it with, at most, minor modification.
